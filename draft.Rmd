#Exploring Salary Potential

Do stem majors end up making more?
```{r}
ggplot(aes(stem_percent, mid_career_pay), data = salary_potential) +
  geom_point()
```

Do stem majors say that they make the world better?
```{r}
ggplot(aes(stem_percent, make_world_better_percent), data = salary_potential) +
  geom_point()
```



Does high tuition pay off?
```{r}
# Combine the salary and tuition tables
tuition_salary <- salary_potential %>%
  left_join(tuition_cost, by = "name")

# Remove 2 year degrees
tuition_salary %>%
  filter(degree_length != '2 year') %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(out_of_state_tuition, early_career_pay), data = tuition_salary)
```

same graph again but visualize by cost of living
